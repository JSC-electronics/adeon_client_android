Control Arduino over SMS using your Android phone.

This client app was made as our official client for [Adeon](https://github.com/JSC-electronics/Adeon). At the moment, we no longer actively maintain this project. But we updated the sources to support latest Android 13 and we also removed the Ads. Source code is now fully available and anyone can build this using latest Android Studio.

## Building Adeon
This app uses includes a modified version of [android-phone-field](https://github.com/lamudi-gmbh/android-phone-field) library for phone widget. It has been added as a local module to simplify the build process.

You should be able to build this application with no issues. We've also included pre-compiled APKs which you can find [here](https://github.com/JSC-electronics/adeon_client_android/releases/).

Check out [this app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cz.jscelectronics.adeon) in our Google Play Store.
